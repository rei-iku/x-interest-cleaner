## 🔑 Getting Your Authentication Tokens

You'll need to extract 4 tokens from your X session. We provide three methods:

### Method 1: Browser Console Script (Easiest)

1. Go to [x.com](https://x.com) and log in
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Copy and paste the contents of `get_config_file.js`
5. Press Enter
6. A `config.json` file will be downloaded automatically

### Method 2: Bookmarklet

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Drag the "🔑 Extract X Tokens" button to your bookmarks bar
3. Go to [x.com](https://x.com) and log in
4. Click the bookmark
5. Download the generated `config.json`

### Method 3: Manual Entry

Run the script with the `--manual` flag and enter tokens when prompted:
```bash
python x_interest_cleaner.py --manual
```

## 🏃 Running the Script

Once you have your `config.json`:

```bash
# Run with config file
python x_interest_cleaner.py --config config.json

# Or if config.json is in the same directory
python x_interest_cleaner.py

# Preview what will be disabled (dry run)
python x_interest_cleaner.py --dry-run
```

## 📖 Command Line Options

```
usage: x_interest_cleaner.py [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--manual] [--create-config] [--dry-run]

Clean all X interests - Stop seeing trash in your timeline

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG
                        Path to config file with tokens
  --manual, -m          Enter tokens manually
  --create-config       Create sample config file
  --dry-run             Show what would be disabled without making changes
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

The `config.json` file needs these tokens:

```json
{
  "bearer_token": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMLheAAA...",
  "csrf_token": "your_csrf_token_here",
  "ct0": "your_ct0_value_here",
}
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Could not find ct0 cookie"
- Make sure you're logged in to X
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear cookies and log in again

### "Failed to fetch interests"
- Your tokens may have expired
- Extract fresh tokens and try again

### Rate limiting
- X may temporarily block requests if you run the script too frequently
- Wait a few minutes and try again

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Authenticates** with X using your session tokens
2. **Fetches** all current interests from your account
3. **Retrieves** previously disabled interests
4. **Combines** both lists and removes duplicates
5. **Disables** all interests in a single API call
